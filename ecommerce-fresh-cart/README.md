🛒 E-Commerce Website

A responsive e-commerce web application built with Next.js / React / Tailwind CSS.
This project demonstrates core frontend features of an e-commerce platform such as product browsing, cart, wishlist, and checkout flow.

⚡ Note: This is a frontend-only demo project. Authentication, backend APIs, and database integrations are not implemented. Some features are mock (static / UI-only).

✨ Features

📦 Product Listing – Browse products in a clean UI

🔍 Search Bar (Mock) – UI available, but not functional

❤️ Add to Wishlist – Add/remove items (UI functionality only)

🛒 Add to Cart – Add items to cart and view cart summary

💳 Checkout Page – Checkout flow UI designed (no backend logic)

👤 User Account (Mock) – Sign in / Sign up forms created as static components
